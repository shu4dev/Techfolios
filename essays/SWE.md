When I was a child, I had a weird habit for disassembling everything in my sight, from toys to shelves. This habit became rather destructive since I lacked the ability to reassemble things properly. Consequently, it caused considerable trouble for both my parents and my kindergarten teacher. On the bright side, I found mathematics and science were my favorite subjects in school. It was my teacher who recommended a potential career in engineering for me. 

The field of engineering encompasses numerous specialties. After some experiences in different engineering, I  eventually narrowed down my choices to physics-related careers, specifically electrical engineering, astrophysics, and computer engineering. It was during high school that I began my journey into coding, with Python being my first programming language. I wrote programs to control Arduino robots, and although they were relatively simple, this experience ignited a clear path in my mind regarding my future engineering pursuits.
 
 ## I enjoy coding; I want to write code for my profession.
As a result, I decided not to pursue a general engineering major but instead pursue a computer science degree. I want to become a software engineer. I realized that coding represented only 30% of the job, with the remaining 70% consisting of tasks such as communication, collaboration, and the development of other soft skills. Therefore, I recognized the importance of enhancing not only my coding abilities but also my capacity to communicate and collaborate effectively with fellow software engineers. 

## Do I apply my disassembling habits to software engineering?
My habits for disassembling things underwent a transform from physical objects to conceptual ones. Instead of disassembling toys, I found myself breaking down tasks and problems that software engineers deal with, and reasonably these smaller components to accomplish the original objectives. I hadn't lost my disassembling tendencies; rather, I had adapted and complemented them with the skill of reassembly. 

Starting from what might have seemed like peculiar and vexatious habits, I gradually discovered the most fitting career path and ultimately chose to become a software engineer. As I mentioned in the preceding paragraph, I am committed to not only enhancing my coding skills but also acquiring soft skills such as communication, collaboration, and even presentation abilities. With my idiosyncratic habits and the full range of skills I intend to develop, I am confident that I will be well-prepared for a software engineering role in the industry.
