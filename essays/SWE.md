Disassemble the world
	 When I was a kid, I liked to disassemble everything I saw, from toys to shelves. It was an annoying habit because I didn’t have the ability to assemble it back completely. Therefore, it causes many troubles to my parents and teacher in kindergarten. On the other hand, math and science are my favorite subjects in school. My teacher recommended that I become an engineer in the future. Engineer? That sounds fun.

There are numerous types of engineers, which one do I like? After a deeper research on different careers, I narrowed down my choices to physics related subjects,specifically, electrical, astrophysics and computer engineering. Until high school, I started to learn coding. My first coding language was python. I was writing a program to control the arduino robots. Although it is just a simple program, it inspires me of which engineering path I want to follow. 

“I like coding I want write code for my job”
	Therefore, I didn't choose any engineering major but instead majored in computer science. I want to be a software engineer in the future. As I dive into the career, I understand that writing code is only 30% of my job. The rest 70% consists of communication, collaboration, and other soft skills. Beside improving my coding skills, I also need to learn how to communicate and collaborate with other software engineers.
	I like to disassemble things related to software engineering? 
	My disassembly habits transfer from physical object to conceptual object. Instead of disassembling toys, I disassemble tasks or questions that software engineers are trying to solve, and assemble these small parts back together to complete the original task. I didn’t lose my disassemble habits, instead transferring and complementing it with the ability to reassemble back. 
	Starting from weird and annoying habits, I gradually found the fittest career and eventually chose to be a software engineer. Like I mentioned in the previous paragraph, as I keep improving my coding skills I would also like to gain some soft skills such as communication, collaboration, and even presenting skills. With my weird habits and all the skills that I will be gaining, I am sure that I will be ready to be competent for a software engineering position in the industry.
