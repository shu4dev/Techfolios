When I was a child, I had a weird habit for disassembling everything in my sight, from toys to shelves. This habit became rather destructive since I lacked the ability to reassemble things properly. Consequently, it caused considerable trouble for both my parents and my kindergarten teacher. On the bright side, I found mathematics and science were my favorite subjects in school. It was my teacher who recommended a potential career in engineering for me. 
The field of engineering encompasses numerous specialties. After some experiences in different engineering, I  eventually narrowed down my choices to physics-related careers, specifically electrical engineering, astrophysics, and computer engineering. It was during high school that I began my journey into coding, with Python being my first programming language. I wrote programs to control Arduino robots, and although they were relatively simple, this experience ignited a clear path in my mind regarding my future engineering pursuits.
 

## I like coding I want write code for my job
	Therefore, I didn't choose any engineering major but instead majored in computer science. I want to be a software engineer in the future. As I dive into the career, I understand that writing code is only 30% of my job. The rest 70% consists of communication, collaboration, and other soft skills. Beside improving my coding skills, I also need to learn how to communicate and collaborate with other software engineers.
	I like to disassemble things related to software engineering? 
	My disassembly habits transfer from physical object to conceptual object. Instead of disassembling toys, I disassemble tasks or questions that software engineers are trying to solve, and assemble these small parts back together to complete the original task. I didnâ€™t lose my disassemble habits, instead transferring and complementing it with the ability to reassemble back. 
	Starting from weird and annoying habits, I gradually found the fittest career and eventually chose to be a software engineer. Like I mentioned in the previous paragraph, as I keep improving my coding skills I would also like to gain some soft skills such as communication, collaboration, and even presenting skills. With my weird habits and all the skills that I will be gaining, I am sure that I will be ready to be competent for a software engineering position in the industry.
