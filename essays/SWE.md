On August 6, 1991, the first website was created by Tim Berners-Lee. Since then, the World Wide Web has undergone a remarkable evolution, transforming the way we communicate, access information, and conduct business. JavaScript has taken this evolution to the next level. In my opinion, it opens up infinite possibilities on the HTML canvas. It has the power to change a simple white canvas into a calculator, a map, a game, or anything else one can imagine. As someone who has prior experience with JavaScript in ES5, rather than considering ES6 as an entirely new language, it feels more like an update to the existing one. 

As a potential future software engineer, one of my key responsibilities will be ensuring seamless communication through various media. To be competent in fulfilling this duty, mastering JavaScript is a necessity. Moreover, as previously mentioned, JavaScript unlocks numerous possibilities for web development. Thus, acquiring proficiency in JavaScript is essential for creating dynamic and interactive websites that captivate users in innovative ways. 

When it comes to mastering JavaScript, practice becomes crucial. The professor's decision to incorporate Workouts of the Day (WODs) for coding practice is a strategy I find both challenging and beneficial. While these time-bound exercises might induce stress, it is precisely this pressure that enhances our coding abilities. The mild stress under a time constraint compels my brain to function optimally. Of course, there might be instances when I do not arrive at the best solution and fail a WOD. However, I firmly believe that consistent practice with WODs will inevitably refine my coding skills to a level suitable for technical interviews.
